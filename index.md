_we_ are Citizen.

_we_ are inspired by the idea of citizenship - being conscious, active members of society, on a local and global level.

_we_ enjoy working for organisations, no matter how big or small, who seek to make the world a better place.

_we_ provide bespoke fundraising solutions for causes we love.

_we_ believe in the power of collaboration; working with a talented collective on a common cause.

_we_ are small and agile and donâ€™t agree with a rigid approach to fees. We identify the areas where we can be most helpful, working closely with our clients to deliver effective solutions within their budget.

So _you_ get big agency expertise with our small agency flexibility, with work individually tailored to your needs.
