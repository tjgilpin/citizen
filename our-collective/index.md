Citizen was founded by two people who together provide more than 20 years of agency and charity experience and expertise.  They are:

_Amy Gilpin - client services._
Amy has been working with organisations on various online and offline marketing strategies and campaigns for over twelve years. She has developed strategies for charities such as RSPB and Save The Children, content creators Pencil, and Youth Agency Livity.

_Tain Oliff - strategic planning._
Tain has been working with the charity sector for eleven years, for a diverse range of organisations and an equally diverse number of causes.  Charities such as the RSPCA, The Brooke, MS Society, NSPCC, Save The Children and Unicef have benefited from her problem-solving, people-centred and creative strategising.

We call on the skills of various strategic and creative partners who we have been lucky to work with along the way, to ensure we can provide the best solutions, whatever the brief.
