We were invited to work on the new Amnesty International lottery product. We needed a way to promote the product that didn’t jar with their donor’s view of the charity. We did this by framing the product as:

‘A new way to support Amnesty’
**Giving with benefits**

Flexible solutions: as this was a new product and returns were hard to predict, we developed a segmentation and testing strategy which allowed the client to test the product within a limited budget, whilst still generating learnings which are being used to refine the product and targeting moving forward.
