## Amnesty International

We were invited to work on the new Amnesty International lottery product. We needed a way to promote the product that didn’t jar with their donor’s view of the charity. We did this by framing the product as:

>A new way to support Amnesty  
**Giving with benefits**

Flexible solutions: as this was a new product and returns were hard to predict, we developed a segmentation and testing strategy which allowed the client to test the product within a limited budget, whilst still generating learnings which are being used to refine the product and targeting moving forward.

## Farm Africa

Farm Africa were looking to develop a new legacy identity based on supporter insight but didn’t have the budget to run focus groups.

Flexible solutions: as a small charity, they are very close to their supporters so we proposed an insight workshop with the client and some volunteers who dealt with supporters first hand. From this we picked out key motivations that we distilled into a key message. Their supporters were practical people who wanted to be involved but also saw that farming would be an investment for the future, and they wanted to be a part of that future:

* Ending hunger in Africa is in our hands
* Your hands: by leaving a gift in your will
* Our hands: we have the knowledge
* Their hands: they have the power
